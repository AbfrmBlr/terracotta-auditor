= Auditor

The Auditor is a tool to verify integrity of systems of records.

== How to use

There are two fundamental pieces: the *Journal* and the *Verifier*.

=== Journal

The journal is meant to be used by an application exercising the system of records under test.
Every single operation applied onto the system of records must be logged into the journal to
be analyzed later on by the Verifier.

=== Verifier

The Verifier reads back the data logged by the journal then re-applies the operations that were
executed against the system of records in the order they happened. When multiple operations did happen
concurrently, the Verifier figures out the potentially correct orders and carry on with potentially
multiple execution branches. As it goes on, it collects all the integrity errors it finds.
